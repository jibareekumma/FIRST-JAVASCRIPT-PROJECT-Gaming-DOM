NUMBER GUESSING GAME
A fun JavaScript-based guessing game where you try to guess the secret number before your points run out. 
This is my first JavaScript project as well, built completely from scratch after learning the core concepts in a project. 
No copy or paste, just logic, problem-solving, and a lot of debugging!!

INSPIRATION
Inspired by my javascript course and mentor Jonas Schedttman, but fully rewritten with my own logic, structure, and improvements.
